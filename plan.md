1. Introduction & Setup
Welcome to our web development project! In this initiative, we will build a fully functional web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout this process, we’ll integrate version control, collaborative tools, and structured planning to ensure a smooth development experience.

Key Aspects of the Project
Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Version Control: Git & GitHub for collaboration

Roles & Responsibilities:

Figma Designers: Create wireframes and UI/UX design

Developers: Implement frontend and interactive features

Documentation & Testing: Maintain project documentation and test functionality

2. Persona & Client Brief
Each team will either be assigned or choose a persona that represents the target user. This will guide all design and development decisions.

Persona Profile Includes
Background (26 years old avid gamer passionate about competetive play, game review, and community)

App Idea (A social app that connects games, offers tournament organization,game news, and community)

Design Suggestions (color black,neongreen, and  electric Blue , fonts, visual preferences)

Target Audience (age group, demographics, user needs)

Vision :We envision a premier online destination for Tetris and Tekken tournaments, recognized for its user-friendly interface, competitive integrity, and passionate community. Our goal is to expand and evolve, becoming the go-to platform for structured and high-quality esports competitions in these iconic games.

Mission:We envision a premier online destination for Tetris and Tekken tournaments, recognized for its user-friendly interface, competitive integrity, and passionate community. Our goal is to expand and evolve, becoming the go-to platform for structured and high-quality esports competitions in these iconic games.

Offerings (Tournament scheduling game,news ,live streaming intergration,community chat)

3. Project Planning
To ensure efficient collaboration, teams will:
✅ Form groups and assign responsibilities.
✅ Outline the initial project requirements based on the persona’s prompt.
✅ Develop a timeline with key milestones.

Project Milestones
Milestone	Task	Deadline
Week 1	Initial Planning & Wireframes
Week 2	HTML & CSS Development	
Week 3	JavaScript & Interactivity	
Week 4	Testing & Final Adjustments	


4. Team Collaboration Tools
We will be using industry-standard tools to streamline our workflow:

 GitHub (Version Control)
Purpose: Allows collaborative coding, version tracking, and issue management.

Setup: Teams will create a repository and manage branches efficiently.

 Figma (UI/UX Design)
Purpose: Wireframing, prototyping, and visual design.

Usage: Designers will use Figma to create mockups and share design components.

 Documentation & Testing
Teams will maintain a README.md file with project details.
